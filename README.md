## Linear-Algebra
This repository contains the implementation of Matrix / Column Vectors behavior for solving linear systems of equations through: Gauss elimination, Jacobi iterative methods, and Seidel iterative methods.

# cin >> inputFormat >> endl;
Matrix and Column vectors can be created by their size; Also, overloaded operators for the input / output for these classes.
